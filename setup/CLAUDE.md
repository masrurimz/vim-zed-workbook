## üìã Learning Task Management

### üéØ Vim Learning Todos (Structured Practice)

Use TodoWrite for systematic vim skill development:

**Tier 1: Skill Development Goals**
- Pattern: `"Master: [Vim Topic]" | Context: @vim-zed-workbook/lessons/[lesson]/ | Practice: exercises/[category]/`
- Purpose: Link to lesson materials and practice exercises
- Context: Lesson documentation + hands-on exercises

**Tier 2: Technique Mastery**  
- Pattern: `"Technique: [Movement/Edit Pattern]" | Keys: [key-sequence] | Files: practice/[files] | Muscle: repeat-N-times`
- Purpose: Focus on specific key sequences and muscle memory
- Context: Targeted practice files + repetition tracking

**Tier 3: Application Practice**
- Pattern: `"Apply: [vim-pattern]" | Context: real-project/file.js:42 | Goal: [specific-edit-task]`
- Purpose: Apply learned patterns to real code
- Context: Actual project files + specific editing objectives

**Example: Learning Text Objects**

```markdown
## Master Todos
- [ ] Master: Text Objects | Context: @vim-zed-workbook/lessons/02-motions/ | Practice: exercises/javascript/text-objects.js

## Technique Todos  
- [ ] Technique: Change Inner Word | Keys: ciw | Files: practice/words.txt | Muscle: repeat-50-times
- [ ] Technique: Delete Around Quotes | Keys: da" | Files: practice/strings.js | Muscle: repeat-30-times
- [ ] Technique: Yank Inside Parens | Keys: yi( | Files: practice/functions.js | Muscle: repeat-40-times

## Application Todos
- [x] Apply: ciw for variable rename | Context: my-project/src/utils.js:15 | Goal: rename getUserData to fetchUserInfo
- [ ] Apply: da" for string cleanup | Context: my-project/src/config.js:8 | Goal: remove hardcoded strings
```

## üîç AI-Assisted Learning Discovery

### Learning Workflow Integration

**Discovery Pattern:** Use AI to identify vim improvement opportunities

```markdown
## Learning Discovery Commands
- Task("find inefficient editing patterns in my code")
- Task("identify repetitive tasks suitable for vim macros") 
- Task("suggest vim motions for complex navigation scenarios")
- Task("recommend text objects for current codebase patterns")
```

**AI Learning Prompts:**
- "Analyze my editing patterns and suggest vim optimizations"
- "Show me the most efficient vim sequence for [specific editing task]"
- "What text objects would help with [language/framework] development?"
- "Create practice exercises for [vim concept] using my project files"

---

## üß¨ Code-Integrated Learning

### Real-World Vim Application

**Learning Through Coding:**
- Use actual project files for vim practice
- Apply new vim patterns during regular development
- Document vim discoveries in code comments
- Create vim-optimized code structures

**AI-Suggested Practice:**
```javascript
// PRACTICE: Use ci" to change these strings efficiently
const messages = {
  error: "Something went wrong",     // Practice target: ci"
  success: "Operation completed",   // Practice target: ci"  
  warning: "Please check input"     // Practice target: ci"
};

// PRACTICE: Use ciw to rename these variables
function processUserData(userData) {  // Practice: ciw on userData
  const userInfo = userData.profile;  // Practice: ciw on userInfo
  return userInfo;                   // Practice: ciw on userInfo  
}
```

### Learning Integration Patterns

**During Development:**
1. **Identify inefficiency** - Notice repeated keystrokes
2. **Ask AI for vim solution** - "What's the vim way to do X?"
3. **Practice immediately** - Apply suggestion 5-10 times
4. **Document learning** - Add to practice log
5. **Integrate into workflow** - Use in next similar situation
