## ðŸ“š Concepts

### AI Assistant Panel

Zed's AI assistant provides conversational help for complex coding tasks.

**Core Commands:**
- `space a c` - Toggle AI chat panel
- `cmd-enter` - Send message to AI
- `cmd-n` - New conversation thread
- `cmd->` - Quote selection for AI context

**Use Cases:**
- **Code Explanation** - Understand complex algorithms
- **Architecture Planning** - Design system components  
- **Debugging Help** - Analyze error patterns
- **Code Review** - Get suggestions for improvements
- **Learning** - Understand new technologies

### Inline Assistance

Inline assistance provides contextual AI help directly in your editor.

**Command:** `ctrl+enter` (with text selected)

**Inline Patterns:**
- **Code Generation** - Create functions from comments
- **Refactoring** - Improve selected code blocks
- **Documentation** - Generate JSDoc/docstrings
- **Testing** - Create test cases for functions
- **Optimization** - Suggest performance improvements

**Benefits:**
- Preserves vim workflow
- Maintains editor context
- Quick iterations on code
- No context switching

### AI-Assisted Refactoring

Combine AI suggestions with vim editing for powerful refactoring workflows.

**Pattern:**
1. Select code with vim text objects (`vi{`, `vap`)
2. Use `ctrl+enter` for AI suggestions
3. Apply suggestions with vim editing commands
4. Iterate and refine with additional AI input

**Common Refactoring Tasks:**
- Extract functions from complex methods
- Rename variables for clarity
- Optimize algorithms
- Add error handling
- Improve type safety

### Context-Aware Development

AI assistance works best with proper context and clear instructions.

**Context Strategies:**
- **Select Relevant Code** - Highlight specific functions/classes
- **Include Comments** - Add context about intent and constraints
- **Quote Error Messages** - Use `cmd->` to include full error context
- **Reference Files** - Mention related files and their purposes

**Effective AI Prompts:**
- Be specific about desired outcome
- Mention programming language and framework
- Include constraints (performance, compatibility)
- Ask for explanations with code changes

## ðŸŽ® Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Code Explanation Workflow

**Setup**: Find a complex function in any codebase

**Tasks**:
1. Select the function with `vi{` or `vaf`
2. Press `space a c` to open AI chat
3. Use `cmd->` to quote the selection
4. Ask: "Explain this function and its complexity"
5. Follow up with specific questions about edge cases

**Success Criteria**: âœ… You understand how to get detailed code explanations

### Exercise 2: Inline Code Generation

**Setup**: Create a new file with just function comments

**Tasks**:
```javascript
// Function to validate email format and check if domain exists
// Should return object with isValid boolean and error message
// Handle edge cases like empty string and malformed emails
```

1. Select the comment block with `vip`
2. Press `ctrl+enter`
3. Request: "Generate the function implementation"
4. Use vim editing to refine the generated code
5. Test and iterate with additional AI requests

**Success Criteria**: âœ… You can generate working code from specifications

### Exercise 3: Refactoring with AI

**File**: Create a function with multiple responsibilities

**Tasks**:
```javascript
function processUserData(userData) {
    // Validation
    if (!userData.email || !userData.name) return null;
    if (userData.email.indexOf('@') === -1) return null;
    
    // Data transformation  
    const cleanData = {
        email: userData.email.toLowerCase().trim(),
        name: userData.name.trim(),
        createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    
    // Database operations
    const user = database.createUser(cleanData);
    sendWelcomeEmail(user.email);
    logUserCreation(user.id);
    
    return user;
}
```

1. Select function with `vif`
2. Use `ctrl+enter` â†’ "Refactor this function to follow single responsibility principle"
3. Apply suggestions using vim editing commands
4. Create separate functions with AI help
5. **Challenge**: Ask AI to generate tests for refactored functions

**Success Criteria**: âœ… You can collaboratively refactor complex code

### Exercise 4: Debugging with AI Context

**Setup**: Create a bug in your code that's not immediately obvious

**Tasks**:
1. Include error message and stack trace
2. Select problematic code section
3. Use `space a c` and `cmd->` to provide context
4. Ask: "Help debug this error, here's the code and error message"
5. Apply suggested fixes using vim motions
6. **Advanced**: Ask for prevention strategies

**Success Criteria**: âœ… You can efficiently debug with AI assistance

### Exercise 5: Documentation Generation

**File**: Create functions without documentation

**Tasks**:
1. Position cursor above function
2. Select function signature with `vi(`
3. Use `ctrl+enter` â†’ "Generate JSDoc documentation"
4. Edit generated docs with vim motions
5. **Challenge**: Generate README sections for your module

**Success Criteria**: âœ… You can quickly create comprehensive documentation
