## 📊 Scoring Methodology

### Base Scoring Formula
```
Score = (Time Bonus × Accuracy × Efficiency) × Difficulty Multiplier
```

### Scoring Components

**Time Bonus** (50% weight)
- Under target time: `2.0x` multiplier
- 10% over target: `1.5x` multiplier  
- 25% over target: `1.0x` multiplier
- 50% over target: `0.5x` multiplier
- 100% over target: `0.1x` multiplier

**Accuracy** (30% weight)
- Perfect result: `1.0x`
- Minor issues: `0.8x`
- Major issues: `0.5x`
- Incomplete: `0.2x`

**Efficiency** (20% weight)
- Keystrokes under optimal: `1.2x`
- Within 10% of optimal: `1.0x`
- Within 25% of optimal: `0.8x`
- Over 25% of optimal: `0.6x`

### Difficulty Multipliers
- Intermediate: `1x`
- Advanced: `2x`
- Expert: `4x`
- Master: `8x`

### Score Grades
- **S**: 800-1000 pts (Sublime)
- **A**: 600-799 pts (Excellent) 
- **B**: 400-599 pts (Good)
- **C**: 200-399 pts (Fair)
- **D**: 1-199 pts (Needs Work)
- **F**: 0 pts (Failed)

## 🎯 Getting Started

### Prerequisites Check
Before starting challenges, ensure you have:
- [ ] Completed lessons 1-3 (minimum for intermediate)
- [ ] Vim-Zed setup with custom keymap
- [ ] Timer application ready
- [ ] Quiet, focused environment
- [ ] Growth mindset for failure and learning

### Your First Challenge
Start with **Intermediate Speed Trial #1**:
1. Read the challenge requirements
2. Set up your environment
3. Start timer and begin
4. Score yourself honestly
5. Analyze and improve

### Challenge Rules
1. **No cheating** - Honor system, but you're only cheating yourself
2. **Time pressure** - Use a visible timer
3. **No external help** - No Google, AI, or documentation during timed portions
4. **Record attempts** - Track your progress over time
5. **Learn from failure** - Analyze what went wrong

## 🚀 Tips for Success

### Mental Preparation
- **Warm up** with basic exercises first
- **Visualize** the solution before starting
- **Stay calm** under time pressure
